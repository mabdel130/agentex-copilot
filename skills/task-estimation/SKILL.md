  Creates QA testing tasks with estimation on Azure DevOps User Stories. Use this skill
  whenever the user wants to: add QA tasks to sprint stories in Azure DevOps, estimate testing
  hours for user stories, create [Testing] tasks on ADO work items, plan QA effort for a
  sprint, or break down stories into testing tasks with hours. Trigger on phrases like
  "create tasks for stories", "add QA tasks", "estimate sprint", "create testing tasks",
  "plan QA for sprint", "add tasks to stories", or any mention of sprint stories + estimation
  + testing.

# QA Task Estimation & Task Creation (Azure DevOps)

Automates QA testing-task creation on Azure DevOps User Stories, estimated by story complexity.
This file is the **workflow** (what tasks, how to estimate, when to confirm). The `az boards` /
`az devops` command mechanics live in the reference — **read it before the first `az boards`
command in a session**:

- **`../../references/tracker/ado-boards-cli.md`** (relative to this plugin's root) —
  extension install, `az devops configure`, work-item create/show/query, WIQL
  `@CurrentIteration`, parent linking, delete, and the known gotchas.

Base `az` install/auth is covered by the sibling **azure-integration** skill — read its
`references/azure-cli.md` if `az` itself isn't installed or you aren't logged in.

## Configuration (never hardcode)

Read these once at the start of a session — from the values the user gives you, or from an
existing `az devops configure --defaults`. If any is unknown, **ask the user once** and reuse it
for the whole session. Do not bake an organization, project, team, or email into commands.

| Setting | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Organization URL | `azure.org` (`config/project.json`) → `AZURE_URL` / ask | `https://dev.azure.com/<org>` |
| Project | `azure.project` (`config/project.json`) → `AZURE_PROJECT` / ask | `My Project` |
| Team | `azure.team` (`config/project.json`) → `AZURE_TEAM` / ask | `My Project Team` |
| Default assignee | `azure.assignee` (`config/project.json`) → `AZURE_ASSIGNEE` / ask | `qa.engineer@example.com` |
| PAT (auth) | `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` env in the user's shell — **never** print or pass it | — |

(Config lives in `config/project.json`'s `azure` block or legacy `AZURE_*` keys in `.env`.
NEVER print, log, or pass the PAT (or any secret) anywhere — auth flows through the
`AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` env var that the user exports in their shell.)

## Task template

Every User Story gets exactly **5 QA tasks** — no more, no less:

| Task Title | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `[Testing] Requirement Review` | Review ACs, scenarios, edge cases |
| `[Testing] Test Creation` | Write test cases |
| `[Testing] Test Execution` | Run test cases |
| `[Testing] Bug Review and Retest` | Verify bug fixes |
| `[Testing] Automation` | Automate test scenarios |

Every task must set, at create time: `--type Task`, `--title "[Testing] <name>"`,
`--iteration <parent story's iteration>`, `--assigned-to <assignee>`,
`Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Activity=Testing`, and `OriginalEstimate`/`RemainingWork` = the estimated
hours — then link it to its parent story. Exact commands are in the reference.

## Estimation factors

Score these from the story's description + ACs before estimating:

| Factor | What to count |
|---|---|
| Scenarios / ACs | Given/When/Then scenarios |
| UI Elements | Fields, buttons, dropdowns, toggles |
| Validations | Inline errors, required fields, min/max rules |
| Conditions / Logic | Branching behavior, default states, toggles |
| Error Messages | Inline errors + toasts + API failures |
| API Integrations | External service calls (identity verification, maps, etc.) |
| Translations | EN/AR string pairs |
| Edge Cases | Explicitly listed failure modes |

## Estimation guidelines

### Complexity buckets

| Complexity | Story Points | Indicators |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple** | 2–3 SP | 2–3 scenarios, few fields, Yes/No inputs, minimal validations |
| **Medium** | 5 SP | 3–4 scenarios, 5–7 fields, dropdowns with many options, some validations |
| **Heavy** | 8+ SP | 5+ scenarios, map/API integration, 7+ fields, many edge cases, 20+ translations |

### Hours per task by complexity

| Task | Simple | Medium | Heavy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Requirement Review | 1h | 1h | 2h |
| Test Creation | 1h | 1–2h | 3–4h |
| Test Execution | 1h | 1–2h | 3h |
| Bug Review & Retest | 1h | 1h | 2h |
| Automation | 1h | 1–2h | 3h |
| **Total** | **5h** | **5–8h** | **13–14h** |

> Always **show the estimate and ask the user to confirm or adjust** before creating tasks.

## Workflow

0. **Resolve config** — organization, project, team, assignee (see Configuration). Ask once if
   missing.
1. **Get current iteration** — fetch the current sprint dynamically (never hardcode); see reference.
2. **Fetch sprint stories** — WIQL query for User Stories in the current iteration; show a
   summary table: ID | Title | State | Story Points.
3. **Process one story at a time** — for each:
   1. Fetch details (`work-item show --expand all`).
   2. Analyze description + ACs against the estimation factors.
   3. Show the analysis: factor counts, complexity bucket, proposed hours per task.
   4. **Ask for confirmation** — never create without an explicit "yes" / "approved".
   5. **Check for existing child tasks first** (see reference); if present, ask whether to skip
      or add.
   6. Create the 5 tasks with all mandatory fields, then link each to the parent story.
   7. Move to the next story.

## Rules

- One story at a time — never batch-create across all stories.
- Never create tasks without showing the estimate and getting confirmation.
- Never put a PAT on the command line or read `.env*` — auth is handled via the shell env.
- Always set `--iteration` (inherit the parent story's) and `Activity=Testing` — the two most
  common omissions.
- Ask once for any missing config value, then reuse it for the session.

## Example interaction

```
Bot: Story #12345 — Capture Contact Preferences (3 SP)
     - 3 scenarios · 4 Yes/No questions · Simple complexity
     Proposed: all 5 tasks @ 1h each (Total: 5h). Confirm? [yes / adjust]
User: yes
Bot: [creates 5 tasks — iteration inherited, Activity: Testing, assigned] Done. Next: #12346...
```
